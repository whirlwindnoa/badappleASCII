# badappleASCII

planning on playing bad apple on an iPhone with DFU mode and checkm8 exploit available<br>
therefore decided first to play it on a linux terminal<br><br>

use `make` to build<br>
you need ncurses and SDL to compile it<br><br>

frames created with `ffmpeg -i badapple.mp4 -vf format=gray -s "120:45" frames/%4d.bmp`
